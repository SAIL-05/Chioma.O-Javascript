let myAge = 93;

console.log("Chioma Age is" + " " + myAge); 


// This line is using the + sign to combine strings and values — this process is called string concatenation.

// Here’s what each part does:

// "Chioma Age is" — a string.

// " " — a space (also a string).

// myAge — a variable, which could be a number or a string (like 25 or "25").

// So the + sign in this context means:
// ➡️ “Add these things together as text”



// Important:
// + between numbers = math (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5)

// + with strings = combines text (e.g., "Hello " + "Chioma" = "Hello Chioma")
//   What about ++ then?
// ++ is different. It’s a shortcut for adding 1 to a number. 
// For example:
// let x = 5;
// x++; // now x is 6
